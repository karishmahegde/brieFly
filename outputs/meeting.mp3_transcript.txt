Hi team, thanks for joining today's check-in. Today we'll work on the project milestones. So, so far we're done with the dashboard and the API integration with the endpoints. Next, Alex, you can handle the user auth flow, which I have mentioned last week. Let's aim to get the design by Friday. Priya, can you hear me? Yeah, we'll finalize the backend data models by next Monday or maximum Tuesday. See, the thing is we are falling behind on the internal testing. So we need to have the deliverables by the end of this week. Okay, and unfortunately, Paul is off for the next two weeks. So we'll have to shift his user stories to either Priya or Alex. Oh, I'm also feeling a bit under the weather. I may take the second half off. Oh, okay, fine, fine. Take care. If there are any blockers, raise them immediately in the group. Okay. So yeah, that's all for now. Thanks, everyone. We'll meet back on Wednesday.
